# Accessibility Passport

With the COVID-19 pandemic, getting your vaccine passport scanned is the new norm when dining in at a restaurant. This is what inspired the Accessibility Passport, which uses a QR code to open a communication port between customers with various accessibility needs and the restaurant staff without having to pre-download a mobile application. With a quick scan of a QR code, the waiters are notified in real-time whenever a customer wants to make an order, pay their bill or call over for help at a restaurant.
